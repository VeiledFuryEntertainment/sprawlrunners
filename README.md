# Content Overview
The following Compendiums are available within the module, loaded with official content to help bring your *Sprawlrunners* games to life.  
*<b>Please Note: </b> Try to keep content inside compendiums when possible. Having hundreds or thousands of unneeded Actors, Items, or Journal Entries imported in your world can negatively affect Foundry performance.*
## Rules Compendium
The *Sprawlrunners* rules are organized into the same chapters as the printed book. If you know the title of the article you are looking for, use the search at the top of the Compendiums sidebar so you don't have to dig through multiple folders.  
The rules have deep entity linking, which means that by clicking on the neon blue, underlined text in each article you will be shown more detailed information about the topic you chose. Some of these are subheadings inside a longer entry, so you may need to scroll down and read through the article to find what you're looking for.

## Item Compendiums
The Item compendiums contain all of the Skills, Hindrances, Edges, gear, and powers in the *Sprawlrunners* rules, complete with fully entity-linked descriptions, ready to be dropped onto your actors.
*<b>Note: </b>Because of how Foundry is set up “under the hood”, some things are found in the Item Compendiums that are not traditionally thought of as items in *Savage Worlds* such as Powers, Edges, Hindrances, and Skills. Basically, under Foundry’s logic, if it can be dropped onto or manually added to your character sheet, it’s categorized as an item.*
### Powers, Edges, Hindrances, Skills & Equipment
Contains all of the powers, Edges, Hindrances, Skills, and gear in the *Sprawlrunners* core rules, complete with fully entity linked descriptions, ready to be dropped onto your actors. 

## Other Modules
### Required Modules
<b>Compendium Folders</b>  
This module is installed as a dependency, as it's used to organize the *Savage Worlds* compendium packs in folders until Foundry adds this feature in the core functionality.

## FAQ
### How can I get help regarding my purchased content?
For customer support related to purchased content - please utilize the following channels:  
* For issues with purchasing the content or other problems with the DTRPG web store, please submit a support request at (https://support.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
* For issues or feedback related to the content itself, please <a href="mailto:sprawlrunners@fire.fundersclub.com">email to create a ticket</a> or create an issue directly on this repository.

### When looking in a compendium, it seems none of the items are showing, or only one or two are showing.
Please check that the search bar at the top of the compendium is empty. Usually this problem is caused by leftover words in the search box at the top of the <b>Compendium</b> view. Clearing the search field will allow all entries to be displayed.

If you're looking for help in figuring out how to do something, the *Savage Worlds* community on the official Foundry discord is very active and helpful. You can find answers to *Sprawlrunners* or FoundryVTT related questions under the #swade channel. https://discord.gg/foundryvtt
